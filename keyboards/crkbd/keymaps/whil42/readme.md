# Whil-'s layout for Colemak DH

A 3x6 layout for split ergonomic keywords with both upper, lower modifiers on right keyboard. Based on US keyboard, but with Swedish keys as well.

## Design principles
- Easy to use on both Mac, Linux and Windows
- Easy access to modifier keys, in particular for Emacs
- As close as possible to normal key layouts to reduce muscle memory
  confusion when switching to regular keyboard
- All keys easily accessible

## Features
- Colemak DH as base layer
- Special keys on thumbs and outermost columns.
- Lower layer with full numpad on right and symbols on left
- Raise layer for navigation keys on right and extra symbols on left
- Adjust layer for function keys and other custom keys
- Swedish keys, åäö, on raise layer.
- OS Specific base layers with Mac being default (can be switched on adjust layer)
  - Changes only affect the position of Alt, Super and Ctrl

## Known issues
- Swedish keys won't work in emacs, unless alt is not assigned to meta.

## Disclaimer
This is my personal layout and is subject to evolve further with my tastes. Fork your own copy if you need stability. Suggestions welcome.

# Whil-'s Markstos layout for Colemak DH

A 3x6 layout for split ergonomic keywords initially forked from Maskstos layout. But now heavily modified.

For a detailed description of Markstos see [markstos Corne layout](https://mark.stosberg.com/markstos-corne-3x5-1-keyboard-layout). This layout is based on that layout but significantly modified.

# Differences from Markstos layout
- Colemak DH instead of QWERTY
- 6th column for modifiers, no On Tap Hold just yet.
- Thumb clusters slightly modified to fit my history, coming from
  Advantage 2 and a custom Miryoku layout that'd been used for over a
  year.

# Design principles
- Easy to use on both Mac, Linux and Windows
- Easy access to modifier keys, in particular for Emacs
- Symmetry as much as possible for modifiers
- Thumb cluster for most important keys and modifiers
- No home row mod to reduce number of "impossible to reach key combinations"
- As close as possible to normal key layouts to reduce muscle memory confusion when switching to regular keyboard

# Features
- Symmetric Alt, Ctrl, Super modifiers
- Usable in Emacs
- Colemak DH as base layer
- OS Specific base layers with Mac being default
  - Changes only affect the position of Alt, Super and Ctrl

# Disclaimer

This is my personal layout and is subject to evolve further with my tastes. Fork your own copy if you need stability. Suggestions welcome.
